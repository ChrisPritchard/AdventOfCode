# Advent of Code solutions, 2015

I started this after finishing 2018, so suffice to say I didn't make it on to the board :D

Overall summary: very easy, with almost every problem solvable using a bruteforce solution. The only complex problems were Day 19's second part which required some meta thinking (which I didn't make, instead finding a clever summary on the reddit thread), and Day 22 which required a BFS (and was still vastly simpler than many of the 2018 BFS days). Still, fun.
