# Advent of Code 2016

My solutions for the [Advent of Code competition, Year 2016](https://adventofcode.com/2016)

I did this early 2019, so didn't reach the board obviously :) Just coding practice.

Unlike the other years prior to this (2018, 2015) I haven't put each solution in its own folder as its own project. Instead each is a module called by the central program.fs
