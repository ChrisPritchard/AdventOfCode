# Advent of Code 2017

My solutions for [Advent of Code, 2017](https://adventofcode.com/2017)

> The night before Christmas, one of Santa's Elves calls you in a panic. "The printer's broken! We can't print the Naughty or Nice List!" By the time you make it to sub-basement 17, there are only a few minutes until midnight. "We have a big problem," she says; "there must be almost fifty bugs in this system, but nothing else can print The List. Stand in this square, quick! There's no time to explain; if you can convince them to pay you in stars, you'll be able to--" She pulls a lever and the world goes blurry.

> When your eyes can focus again, everything seems a lot more pixelated than before. She must have sent you inside the computer! You check the system clock: 25 milliseconds until midnight. With that much time, you should be able to collect all fifty stars by December 25th.

> Collect stars by solving puzzles. Two puzzles will be made available on each day millisecond in the advent calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked when you complete the first. Each puzzle grants one star. Good luck!

I started this early-mid 2019, so again, missed the leaderboard :D 

Notes on days:

- Day 17 part 2 was the first problem where I couldn't figure it out. The answer was very simple, and I might a note to that effect in the code.

- Day 18 part 1 was a classic assembly problem, and I made numerous mistakes but *accidentally* got the right answer. Took a bit more effort to fix my solution so it correctly derived the right answer.

- Day 18 part 2 took a long while to get right in my head, and when I finally got it running it took longer before I realised I had a critical bug (two bugs, the first causing an infinite loop and the second the wrong answer).

- Day 20 part 1 I didn't solve myself. My brute force solution consistently gave the wrong answer. Ultimately I went to reddit and found the math way of solving it to my shame :( I redeemed myself somewhat by solving part 2 without (much) issue on my own.

Very few solutions required much code this year, which was nice as I went through them all on holiday :)
