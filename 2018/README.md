# AdventOfCode2018
My solutions to the Advent of Code comp, 2018

https://adventofcode.com/

I started five days behind, and worked on it sporadically, so never got anywhere near the leadboards. Still, it was a great deal of fun :) A good opportunity to brush up on computer science topics and techniques that I hadn't touched since University decades previously (enterprise development doesnt have much call for breadth-first-searches or A*).

Also, due to some other things I've been doing and due to learning a bit of Go, my F# skills have gotten just a touch rusty. This comp certainly sharpened them right back up again! On top of that, I made heavy use of FParsec, a F# parsing library I had only barely used prior. After using it a lot on various days, I am proud to say my skills there are much better now.

Reviewing the comp, the absolute hardest which almost made me quit, was Day 15. The instructions are extensive, and it took me days to get it working. I learnt two things: I am not as smart as I think I am, and when it comes to the AoC, you *need* to follow the instructions *exactly*. For Day 15, even slight differences in interpretation would lead to an incorrect answer. I got it in the end, after reviewing multiple other solutions, but it almost broke me. No other day was anywhere near as difficult.

Most fun was Day 19, where you had to basically transpile some assembly in order to work out what it was doing and find the right answer. Satisfying :)

Overall, a good time. I will be doing it next year, and maybe then I will be fast/good enough to get on the board :) Need to read a few Comp Sci 101 books first though, and maybe master a F# graphing library or something :D
