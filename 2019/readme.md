# Advent of Code 2019

My solutions for [Advent of Code, 2019](https://adventofcode.com/2019). I did this concurrent with the competition, for the first time, racing to try and get on the score board. Below are my times and positions - the score only increases above 0 if you're in the first 100 for a given part:

```
      -------Part 1--------   -------Part 2--------
Day       Time  Rank  Score       Time  Rank  Score
  6   00:17:54   926      0   00:25:46   618      0
  5   00:17:52   164      0   00:27:14   178      0
  4   00:04:51   374      0   00:10:02   318      0
  3   00:13:32   248      0   00:22:15   313      0
  2   00:14:09   907      0   00:19:40   607      0
  1   00:02:56   507      0   00:06:04   259      0
```
