# Advent of Code 2019

My solutions for [Advent of Code, 2019](https://adventofcode.com/2019). I did this concurrent with the competition, for the first time, racing to try and get on the score board. Below are my times and positions - the score only increases above 0 if you're in the first 100 for a given part:

```
      -------Part 1--------   -------Part 2--------
Day       Time  Rank  Score       Time  Rank  Score
 11   00:36:03  1020      0   00:44:58   907      0
 10   01:38:06  1923      0   19:15:01  7152      0 // didn't do this live either. And my laptop died :|
  9   00:25:01   366      0   00:26:15   357      0
  8   00:04:01    58     43   00:12:16   149      0 // woot! First time ever top 100
  7   00:50:10  1792      0   16:34:54  7320      0 // note I didn't do this day live
