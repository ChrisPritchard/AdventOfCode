# Advent of Code 2019

My solutions for [Advent of Code, 2019](https://adventofcode.com/2019). I did this concurrent with the competition, for the first time, racing to try and get on the score board. Below are my times and positions - the score only increases above 0 if you're in the first 100 for a given part:

```
      -------Part 1--------   -------Part 2--------
Day       Time  Rank  Score       Time  Rank  Score
 19   00:05:06   202      0   00:54:47   412      0

 16   00:34:44   925      0   17:33:51  3304      0 // had to go to reddit for this one part 2. Just a quick hint :)
 15   16:42:13  4215      0   17:34:19  3981      0 // pretty much stopped live at this point. also this one was tricky
