# Advent of Code 2020

Let's see how this goes, since I haven't touched F# in a year.

**Update**: As it turns out, pretty good! Even after not doing any F# for that long, focusing mainly on Go, the language came back like riding a bike! Even had the weird experience of not knowing, at the top level of my mind, how to solve a problem but finding my fingers easily typing out the solution.

Anyway, overall, this year has been reasonably simple, with only a few sticking days. For the first ten or so days, I focused on speed solving to get to the top of the private leaderboard I was part of, but would always come back to get a solution that ran in ideally sub 10ms, then sub 100ms, then sub 5s as approp. Later I just focused on solutions that were under those time targets rather than solve speed.

Here are the days of note:

- [Day 5](./Day05.fs): speed solved quick, but only found out the 'trick' later
- [Day 10](./Day10.fs): part 2 I couldn't solve myself, and had to get the trick for. Cool problem.
- [Day 12](./Day12.fs): had a bug and used SDL2 to visualise the solution in order to solve it. There is a trick to this too, but I think I prefer my more accurate/adaptable solution
- [Day 13](./Day13.fs): second problem I needed outside help for. Took me a while (the next day) to work out *how* this worked
- [Day 15](./Day15.fs): 60 seconds for part 2, then 2 seconds, then 1 second, then 600 ms via severe optimisation efforts
- [Day 16](./Day16.fs): a fun problem. I solved it in Go too, [here](./Day16.go), just to see how hard it would be without set methods (basically the same, if more verbose)
- [Day 20](./Day20.fs): probably the hardest 'logic' puzzle. Solved part 1 easily, but part 2 took another day of intermittent theorising and rewrites before I got a 5 second solution

Where I needed help this year (two problems, 10 and 13) I got them from lizthegrey's stream :)
