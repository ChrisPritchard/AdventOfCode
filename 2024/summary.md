# Advent of Code 2024

Only got to maybe day 18 during December, finished the rest in late feb/march 25.

Hardest day was part 2 of Day 24, as it should be :) Took a few runs at that before going for a blog

Also removed all readme texts this year, as that was part of the FAQ I missed (thought it was just the inputs)

As of 10/3/25, have 500 stars on AoC
