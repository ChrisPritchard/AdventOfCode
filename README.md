# Advent of Code

My solutions to the Advent of Code competition: https://adventofcode.com

I started with 2018, 5 days late (and finished a week late). Subsequent years I've done real time, now I'm hooked, and I also went back and did the prior years all the way back to 2015.

All solutions are done using F# and dotnet core. While I use multiple languages, including a lot of Go, in my normal life this is my yearly F# kata to remind myself how beautiful this language is - I do wish it was a bit faster though for the brute forcing challenges :)
